# Challenge 08 - Registers

Now that you've learned about search and replacing within a file, it's time to deal with some more advanced topics.
Registers are just like memory registers in low-level computing.
They're places where you can store text.

#### Commands

* `"` is the command to start to access a register.
Think of it like an adjective.
* If you want to yank something into register `a`, for example, you can use `"ayy`.
* To paste what you've yanked into `a`, use `"ap`
* To see what you have stored in your registers, type `:reg`.

Registers are a hidden gem in vim, take some time to read [this post about them](https://www.brianstorti.com/vim-registers/).
