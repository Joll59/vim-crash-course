# Challenge 02 - Moving around the screen

Moving with `hjkl` works a little, but sometimse code you want to change is really far away.
Don't reach for that mouse!
This challenge is designed to get you used to moving around the screen and re-orienting your view.

#### Commands:
* `ctrl+d` to scroll down one page
* `ctrl+u` to scroll up one page

This challenge can be accomplished exclusively with the above commands plus commands from previous challenges for editing.

#### Intermediate:
* `G` (shift+g) to move to the bottom of the screen
* `gg` to move to the top of the screen, though that really isn't necessarily where you want to go
* `zz` to center the screen where the cursor is
* `A` (shift+a) will go the end of a line and go into insert mode
* `I` (shift+i) will go to the beginning of a line and go into insert mode

#### Advanced

* `/somewhere{ENTER}` will search the page for somewhere, then you can press `n` to cycle to the next occurrence or `shift+n` to cycle to the previous occurrence.
* `{count}j` will jump `count` downwards
* `{count}k` will jump `count` upwards

## Challenge

Here are the tasks to accomplish this in order:
1. At the very bottom of this document find `I'm at the somewhere on the page` and change `somewhere` to `bottom`.
2. Then navigate to the middle and change `somewhere` to `middle`.
3. Then navigate back up right below these instructions and change `somewhere` to `top`.

```
I'm somewhere on the page











































I'm somewhere on the page

















































I'm somewhere on the page
